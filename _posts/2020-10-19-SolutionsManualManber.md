This is a (work in progress) solutions manual to Udi Manber's [Introduction to Algorithms: A Creative Approach](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Creative-Udi-Manber/dp/0201120372/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Manber+algorithms&qid=1603154131&sr=8-1). This is the only textbook I've ever found that  explains how to come up with algorithms rather than pulling them out of thin air and proving various properties about them (like [CLRS](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844), [KT](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Jon-Kleinberg/dp/0321295358), [Erickson](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Jeff-Erickson/dp/1792644833/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Erickson+algorithms&qid=1603153970&s=books&sr=1-1), [Sedgewick](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-4th-Robert-Sedgewick/dp/032157351X/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=Sedgewick+algorithms&qid=1603153982&s=books&sr=1-3), [Ullman](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Alfred-Aho/dp/0201000237/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Ullman+algorithms&qid=1603154083&sr=8-1) and the many others). I hope to transform this forgotten book into a complete self-study resource by providing solutions to all 472 problems. Stay tuned for updates!
