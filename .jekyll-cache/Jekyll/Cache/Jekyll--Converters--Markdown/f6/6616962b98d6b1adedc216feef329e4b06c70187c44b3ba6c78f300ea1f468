<p>This is a divide-and-conquer recurrence relation so we can apply the master theorem. Note that $a = 143640, b = 70, k = 2$. Since $143640 &gt; 70^2 = 4900$, we apply the first case. Thus, the asymptotic running time of this algorithm is given by $O(n^{\log_{70}(143640)})$. This can be simplified to O(n^{2.795})$.</p>
