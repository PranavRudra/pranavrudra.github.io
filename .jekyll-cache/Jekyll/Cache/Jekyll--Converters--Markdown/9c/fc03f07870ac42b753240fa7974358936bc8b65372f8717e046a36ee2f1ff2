<p>We induct on $n$. For the base case, consider $n = 1$. Since we only have two regions, one inside the circle and one outside, we can easily color them with two colors. For the inductive hypothesis, assume the claim holds for $n - 1$ circles. Now, for the inductive step, we will introduce the $n^{th}$ circle $C_n$ and flip the colors of all regions that fall within $C_n$. We must prove that this constitutes a valid coloring of the plane.</p>
