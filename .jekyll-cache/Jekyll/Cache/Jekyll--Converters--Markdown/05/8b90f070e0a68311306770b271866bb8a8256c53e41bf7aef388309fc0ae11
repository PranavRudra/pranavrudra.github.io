<p>Given that $\sqrt{n} &lt; \frac{n}{2}$ for all $n &gt; 4$, we have</p>

\[\begin{align*}
        T(n) &amp;= T\left(\frac{n}{2}\right) + T\left(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\right) + n \\
        &amp;\leq T\left(\frac{n}{2}\right) + T\left(\frac{n}{2}\right) + n \\
        &amp;= 2T\left(\frac{n}{2}\right) + n
    \end{align*}\]

<p>which is a divide-and-conquer recurrence with $a = 2, b = 2, k = 1$.</p>

<p>Hence, by the third case ($a = b^k$) of the master theorem, we know that</p>

\[T(n) = O(n\log(n))\]

<p>However, since $\sqrt{n}$ is much lower than $\frac{n}{2}$ for large $n$, $O(n\log(n))$ might not be the tighest upper bound on the recurrence. To find a tighter bound, we can guess and check different functions, say $T(n) = O(n)$ via induction. We shall try this approach now by attempting to show that $T(n) \leq cn$ for some $</p>
