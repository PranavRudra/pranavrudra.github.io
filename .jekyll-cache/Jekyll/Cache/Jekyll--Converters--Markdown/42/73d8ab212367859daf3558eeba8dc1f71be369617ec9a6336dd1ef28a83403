<p>We will induct on $n$. For the base case ($n = 3$), the theorem is true by assumption. That is, since there are only three points in the plane and every three points belong to a unit size cycle, there is clearly a unit size cycle containing all of the points. For the inductive hypothesis (IH), assume the claim holds for $n - 1$. Now, for the inductive step, we must show that it holds for $</p>
