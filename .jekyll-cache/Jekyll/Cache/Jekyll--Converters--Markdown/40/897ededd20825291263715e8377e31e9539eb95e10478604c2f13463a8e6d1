<p>The given “proof” is invalid since it assumes that each of the two subtrees only has single leaf node. However, in a complete binary tree, every node in the lowest level is a leaf node. Given that a complete binary subtree with $n$ total nodes will have $\left \lceil \frac{n}{2} \right \rceil$ total leaves and $\left \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right \rfloor$ total internal nodes, the total running time for the algorithm should be</p>

\[c + O(k)\left \lceil \frac{n}{4} \right \rceil + c\left \lfloor \frac{n}{4} \right \rfloor\]

\[\qed\]
