<p>We will induct on $n$. For the base case ($n = 3$), refer to the beginning of exercise <a href="/ManberChp2Exercise16/">2.16</a>. For the inductive hypothesis (IH), assume that the claim holds for $n - 1$. Now, for the inductive step, we must show that the $n$ lines $l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_n$ form at least $n - 2$ triangles.</p>

<p>By the inductive hypothesis, we know that $l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{n - 1}$ form at least $n - 3$ triangles. Also, since all lines are in general position, every pair of lines intersects. Hence, let $P$ be the intersection point of $\{l_{n - 1}, l_n \}$, $Q$ be the intersection point of ${l_1, l_2}$, $O$ be the intersection point of ${l_2, l_3 }$.</p>
