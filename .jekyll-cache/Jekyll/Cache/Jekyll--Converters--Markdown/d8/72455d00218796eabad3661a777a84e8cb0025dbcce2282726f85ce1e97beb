I"­<p>This is a (work in progress) solutions manual to Udi Manberâ€™s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Creative-Udi-Manber/dp/0201120372/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Manber+algorithms&amp;qid=1603154131&amp;sr=8-1">Introduction to Algorithms: A Creative Approach</a>. This is the only textbook Iâ€™ve ever found that actuallly explains how to actually design algorithms rather than simply presenting them (like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844">CLRS</a> et al). I hope to transform this forgotten book into a complete self-study resource by providing solutions to all 472 problems. Stay tuned for updates!</p>
