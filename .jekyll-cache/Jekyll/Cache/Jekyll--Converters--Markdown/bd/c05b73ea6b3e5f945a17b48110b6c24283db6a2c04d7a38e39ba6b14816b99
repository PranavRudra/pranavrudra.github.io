<p>We will induct on $n$, the positive integer we are writing as a sum. For the base cases, consider</p>

\[\begin{align*}
        1 &amp;= 1 \\
        2 &amp;= 2 \\
        3 &amp;= 3 \\
        4 &amp;= 4 \\
        5 &amp;= 5 \\
        6 &amp;= 5 + 1 \\
        7 &amp;= 5 + 2 \\
        8 &amp;= 5 + 3 \\
        9 &amp;= 5 + 4
    \end{align*}\]

<p>For the inductive hypothesis (IH), assume that for $10 \leq k &lt; n$ we can write $k$ as a sum of distinct elements of the sequence. Now, for the inductive step, we will show that we can do the same for $n$. Let $t$ be the largest element of the sequence that is less than $n$ and $a_i = 10(2^{i - 1})$ denote the $i$-th element of the geometric part of the sequence. Hence, we have $t = a_q$ where</p>

\[q = \left\lfloor \log_2\left(\frac{n}{10}\right) \right\rfloor + 1 = \left\lfloor \log_2(n) - 3 \right\rfloor + 1\]

\[\qed\]
