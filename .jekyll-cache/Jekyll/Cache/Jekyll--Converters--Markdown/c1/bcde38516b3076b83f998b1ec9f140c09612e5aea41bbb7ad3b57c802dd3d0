<p>We will induct on $n$. For the base case, consider $n = 3$ and let the $3$ lines be $l_1, l_2, l_3$. Since the lines are in general position, no two of them are parallel and no three intersect at a common point. Since no two are parallel, every pair of lines intersect; let $A$ be the intersection between $l</p>
