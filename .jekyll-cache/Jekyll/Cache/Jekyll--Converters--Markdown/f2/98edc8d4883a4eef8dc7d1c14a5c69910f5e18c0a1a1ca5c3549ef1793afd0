I"^<p>Let $A, B, C$ be the three geometric figures. Since $A \cong B$, we can superimpose $A$ onto $B$ such that the two become identified with one another in all their parts (i.e. fit perfectly). The same holds for $B$ and $C$ since $B \cong C$. Therefore, we can also superimpose $A$ (which has been moved to perfectly coincide with $B$) onto $C$</p>
