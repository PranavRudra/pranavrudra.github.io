<p>We solve the recurrence for a few values of $n$ to get a feel for it.</p>

\[\begin{align*}
        T(2) &amp;= 1 \\
        T(4) &amp;= 2T(2) + 1 = 3 \\
        T(8) &amp;= 2T(4) + 1 = 7 \\
        T(16) &amp;= 2T(8) + 1 = 15
    \end{align*}\]

<p>Hence, we propose that $T(n) = n - 1$. We can prove this via induction.</p>

<p>For the base case, consider $n = 2$.</p>

\[T(2) = 2 - 1 = 1\]

<p>For the inductive hypothesis (IH), assume $\forall k &lt; n$</p>

\[T(k) = k - 1\]

<p>Now, for the inductive step, we must show the claim holds for $n$.</p>

\[\begin{alignat*}{2}
        T(n) &amp;= 2T\left(\frac{n}{2}\right) + 1 &amp;&amp;\text{ (by definition of $T(n)$)} \\
        &amp;= 2\left(\frac{n}{2} - 1\right) + 1 &amp;&amp;\text{ (by IH)} \\
        &amp;= n - 1
    \end{alignat*}\]

<p>The textâ€™s attempt to show that $T(n) = O(n)$ by guessing $T(n) \leq cn$ fails because $cn$ is not a tight upper bound. As a result, we can only conclude that $T(n) \leq cn + 1$ when trying to prove the claim via induction (try to do so yourself). To circumvent this issue, we can either guess that $T(n) \leq c_1n - c_2$ where $c_1, c_2$ are constants or we can try to define a new recurrence $S(n)$ such that $T(n) \leq T(n)$ and prove</p>
