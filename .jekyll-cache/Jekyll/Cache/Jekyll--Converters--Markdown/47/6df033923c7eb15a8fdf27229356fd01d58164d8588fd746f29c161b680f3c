<p>We will induct on $n$. For the base case, let the $n = 3$ lines be $l_1, l_2, l_3$. Since the lines are in general position, no two of them are parallel. Hence, every pair of lines intersects. Let $A, B, C$ be the intersections between $\{ l_1, l_2 \}$, $\{l_2, l_3\}$, and $\{l_1, l_3\}$ respectively. Now, recall that no three lines in general position intersect at a common point. Therefore, $A, B, C$ are all distinct. Finally, observe that $A, B, C$ cannot be collinear. If they are, then $l_1 = l_2 = l_3$ and all three intersect at the common points $A, B, C$. Thus, by an elementary theorem in Euclidean geometry, three non-collinear points $A, B, C$ enclose a triangle.</p>

<p>For the inductive hypothesis (IH), assume that the claim holds for $n - 1$. Now, for the inductive step, we must show that adding the $n^{\text{th}} line $l_n$ does not ‚Äúremove‚Äù the triangle region (say $\triangle ABC$) formed by $l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{n - 1}$.</p>
