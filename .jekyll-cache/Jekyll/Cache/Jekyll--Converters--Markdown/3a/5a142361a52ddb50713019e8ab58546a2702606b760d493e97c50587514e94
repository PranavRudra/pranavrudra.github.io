<p>The given ‚Äúproof‚Äù is invalid since it assumes that each of the two subtrees only has single leaf node. However, in a complete binary tree, every node in the lowest level is a leaf node. Therefore, a complete binary subtree with $q = 2^k + 1$ total nodes ($n \geq 2$) will have</p>

\[2^{\left \lfloor \log_{2}\left(\frac{n - 1}{2}\right) \right \rfloor} = 2^{\left \lfloor \log_{2}\left(n - 1\right) - 1 \right \rfloor}\]

<p>total leaves.</p>

\[\qed\]
