<p>We will induct on $n$. For the base case, consider $n = 3$ and let the $3$ lines be $l_1, l_2, l_3$. Since the lines are in general position, no two of them are parallel. Hence, every pair of lines intersects. Let $A, B, C$ be the intersections between $\{ l_1, l_2 \}$, $\{l_2, l_3\}$, and $\{l_1, l_3\}$ respectively. Now, recall that no three lines in general position intersect at a common point. Therefore, $A, B, C$ are all distinct. Finally, observe that $A, B, C$ cannot be collinear; if they are $l_1 = l_2 = l_3$, which implies that all three intersect at each of $A, B, C$.</p>
