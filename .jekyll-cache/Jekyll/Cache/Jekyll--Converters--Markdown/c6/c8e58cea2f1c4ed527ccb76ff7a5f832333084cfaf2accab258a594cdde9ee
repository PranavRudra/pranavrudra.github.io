I"ô<p>Let $A, B, C$ be the three geometric figures. Since $A \cong B$, we can superimpose $A$ onto $B$ such that the two become identified with one another in all parts (i.e. overlap perfectly). The same holds for $B$ and $C$ since $B \cong C$. As a result, we can superimpose $A$ onto $C$ in two steps. First, move $A$ into $B$â€™s position. Then move $A$, which is now in $B$, into $C$â€™s position. Since we have come up with a construction that superimposes $A$ onto $C$ perfectly, $A \cong C$.</p>
