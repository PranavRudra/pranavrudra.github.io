I"1<p>Let $P$ be a plane and $l_1$ a line not contained in $P$ that intersects $P$ at a point $Q$. Further, let $R \ne Q$ be another point in $P$. By an assumed property, there exists a line $l_2$ in $P$ that contains both $R$ and $Q$; this line must be distinct from $l_1$ since $l_2$ lies in $P$ but $</p>
