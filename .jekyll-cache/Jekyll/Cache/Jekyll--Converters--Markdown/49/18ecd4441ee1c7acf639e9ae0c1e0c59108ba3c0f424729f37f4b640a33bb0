<p>We will induct on $n$. For the base case, consider $n = 3$ and let the $3$ lines be $l_1, l_2, l_3$. Since the lines are in general position, no two of them are parallel and no three intersect at a common point. Since no two are parallel, every pair of lines intersect. As a result, let $A$ be the intersection between $l_1, l_2$, $B$ be the intersection between $l_2, l_3$, and $C$ be the intersection between $l_1, l_3$.</p>
