I"8<p>Let $A, B, C$ be the three geometric figures. Since $A \cong B$, we can superimpose $A$ onto $B$ such that the two become identified with one another in all their parts (i.e. fit perfectly). The same holds for $B$ and $C$ since $B \cong C$. Therefore, we can superimpose $A$ onto $C$ in two steps. First,</p>
