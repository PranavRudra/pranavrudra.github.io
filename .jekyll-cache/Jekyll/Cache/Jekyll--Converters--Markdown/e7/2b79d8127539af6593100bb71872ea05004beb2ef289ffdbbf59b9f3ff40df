<p>We induct on $n$. For the base case, consider $n = 1$. Since we only have two regions, one inside the circle and one outside, we can easily color them with two colors. For the inductive hypothesis, assume the claim holds for $n - 1$ circles. Now, for the inductive step, we will introduce the $n^{th}$ circle $C_n$ and flip the colors of all regions that fall within $C_n$.</p>

<p>To prove that this constitutes a valid coloring, consider two adjacent regions $R_1$, $R_2$. We have three cases: both regions lie outside $C_n$, both lie inside $C_n$, or $R_1$ and $R_2$ are separated by $C_n$. In the first, the coloring of $R_1$ and $R_2$ is unaffected by $C_n$. Moreover, by the induction hypothesis, $R_1$ and $R_2$ had different colors before $C_n$ was introduced. As a result, the two regions have different colors.</p>
